Our project is a cognitive assistant technology app designed to support parents in managing children with ADHD. It provides personalized tools, reminders, and strategies to help parents track routines, manage behaviors, and foster positive development. By combining technology with empathy, the app aims to ease daily challenges and enhance the quality of life for both parents and children.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to GDSC for organizing this incredible hackathon, providing us with an inspiring platform to innovate and collaborate on meaningful solutions. Using FlutterFlow and Firebase as our tech stack, we were able to bring our ideas to life with efficiency and creativity. Thank you for fostering an environment that empowers learning and innovation!
